      Lupus is a chronic autoimmune disease where the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissues, leading to inflammation and damage to various parts of the body. Common symptoms include fatigue, joint pain, rash, and fever. Although there is currently no cure, early diagnosis and treatment can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life.
