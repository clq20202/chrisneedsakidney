      <p>"Suffering is the mother of realization; so long as we are not defeated by them, they become the raw material with which to construct lasting happiness." — Daisaku Ikeda
Obstacles are a part of everyone’s life, but it is what you do with that obstacle that counts. My mother often tells me, “God will never give you more than you can handle,” an interpretation of 1 Corinthians 10:13. I have repeated that mantra every time I get sick and every time I am in the hospital. I pick myself up and wipe off the dust. But this time, I need help. I am in kidney failure. I need someone to donate a kidney. 
I have suffered from chronic and debilitating headaches since the age of eight. My headaches were so bad and so frequent that my parents took me out of school and placed me in a private school. Eventually, my headaches were accompanied by fevers, arthritis and weight loss. I remember sitting in Driver's Ed class, barely able to wrap my hands around the steering wheel. I then began having chest pain. Walking up the stairwell to my bedroom each day felt like someone was standing on my chest. I was 16 and thought I was having a heart attack, and it hurt to breath. 
Eventually, I was admitted to intensive care. I had a seizure and was not anemic. Doctors figured out after weeks of tests that my immune system was attacking my heart, lungs, brain, and gastrointestinal system. I was finally diagnosed with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. 
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus! Yes, a strange name that I have learned to pronounce overtime. I learned over time that this meant that my immune system could attack any part of my body as if it were bad like a virus or bacteria. I have told people that I am basically allergic to my own body. 
I eventually graduated from high school and then college, but it was not without struggle. I suffered frequent attacks to my joints, heart and lungs. At some point, I got the bright I idea to go to law school. A few months after graduating from law school, my immune system began attacking my kidneys. 
I now have End Stage Renal Disease, and I was in the hospital 6 times this year. I take 15 medications and physical therapy has become a part of my regular routine. Even with this, I continue to work hard and advocate for those in need. (hyperlink to my advocacy page)
I will soon need dialysis. Dialysis is not my only hope. My hope is that a kind person, like you, sees this page and will consider donating their kidney to me. (hyperlink to donor page)
In the dawn of day there are new horizons.
