      <p>“Suffering is the mother of realization; so long as we are not defeated by it, suffering becomes the raw material with which to construct lasting happiness.” — Daisaku Ikeda

Obstacles are a part of everyone’s life, but it is what we do with those obstacles that truly matters. My mother often tells me, “God will never give you more than you can handle,” an interpretation of 1 Corinthians 10:13. I have repeated that mantra every time I became sick and every time I was hospitalized. I would pick myself up, wipe off the dust, and keep going. But this time, I need help.

I am in kidney failure, and I need a kidney transplant.

I have suffered from chronic, debilitating headaches since the age of eight. They were so severe and frequent that my parents withdrew me from public school and enrolled me in a private school. Over time, the headaches were joined by fevers, arthritis, and significant weight loss. I remember sitting in Driver’s Ed class, barely able to grip the steering wheel. Then came the chest pain. Walking up the stairs to my bedroom felt like someone was standing on my chest. At sixteen years old, I thought I was having a heart attack—it hurt just to breathe.

Eventually, I was admitted to intensive care. I suffered a seizure, and after weeks of testing, doctors discovered that my immune system was attacking my heart, lungs, brain, and gastrointestinal system. I was diagnosed with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus—an unfamiliar name I eventually learned to pronounce and live with. Over time, I learned that lupus means my immune system can attack any part of my body as if it were a virus or bacteria. I often tell people that I am, quite literally, allergic to my own body.

Despite everything, I graduated from high school and then college—but not without struggle. I endured frequent attacks on my joints, heart, and lungs. At one point, I made the bold decision to attend law school. A few months after graduating, my immune system began attacking my kidneys.

I now have End Stage Renal Disease. This year alone, I have been hospitalized six times. I take fifteen medications daily, and physical therapy has become a regular part of my life. Even so, I continue to work hard and advocate for those in need. <a href="#" onclick="event.preventDefault(); document.querySelector('.tab[data-section=&quot;advocacy&quot;]').click();">Learn more about my advocacy work</a>

I will soon need dialysis—but dialysis is not my only hope. My hope is that a kind person, like you, will see this page and consider becoming a living kidney donor. <a href="emory.html">consider becoming a living kidney donor</a>
